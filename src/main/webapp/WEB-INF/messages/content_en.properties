### about
about.origin.title=Do we really need another recipe website?
about.origin.description1=This website was born out of frustration over never being able to find the recipe I was looking for.
about.origin.description2=In my kitchen I have a manila folder bulging with 3x5 note cards, cutouts from newspapers and magazines and printouts from websites - trying to find a specific recipe was a royal pain.
about.origin.description3=In addition, some of my most often used recipes were becoming illegible from years of ink and food stains.
about.origin.description4=One might argue that a simple solution would be to transfer them all to fresh 3x5 cards and store them in a recipe box, a time-honored method used by organized cooks.
about.origin.description5=However, as a retired veteran of decades of software development (and a total nerd), I decided to put that experience to use and thus embarked on creating the RecipeOrganizer website.
about.origin.description6=It has been a fun and very educational exercise building this website and I hope that you enjoy using it as much as I did developing it.
about.background.title=Who originated this website?
about.background.description1=My name is Larry Kear and I spent 35 years working in the software arena as a developer, project manager and director for various companies as well as owning an independent consulting firm.
about.background.description2=Among the companies I worked or consulted for are Keebler Company, Häagen-Dazs Company, Norand Corporation, Pepsi-Cola, Continental Baking Company, NYNEX and Law Bulletin Publishing Company.
about.background.description3=It has been a fascinating journey, from starting out programming in COBOL on mainframes through developing desktop software for Windows 3.1 to creating this cloud-based website.
about.technical.title=Technical details
about.technical.description1=Although I am officially retired, I hope to use this website as a calling card, as it were, for prospective employers that have a short-term need for a skilled web developer.
