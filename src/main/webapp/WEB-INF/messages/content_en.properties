### about
about.origin.title=Do we really need another recipe website?
about.origin.description1=This website was born out of frustration over never being able to find the recipe I was looking for.
about.origin.description2=In my kitchen I have a manila folder bulging with 3x5 note cards, cutouts from newspapers and magazines and printouts from websites - trying to find a specific recipe was a royal pain.
about.origin.description3=In addition, some of my most often used recipes were becoming illegible from years of ink and food stains.
about.origin.description4=One might argue that a simple solution would be to transfer them all to fresh 3x5 cards and store them in a recipe box, a time-honored method used by organized cooks.
about.origin.description5=However, as a retired veteran of decades of software development (and a total nerd), I decided to put that experience to use and thus embarked on creating the RecipeOrganizer website.
about.origin.description6=It has been a fun and very educational exercise building this website and I hope that you enjoy using it as much as I did developing it.
about.background.title=Who originated this website?
about.background.description1=My name is Larry Kear and I spent 35 years working in the software arena as a developer, project manager and director for various companies as well as owning an independent consulting firm.
about.background.description2=Among the companies I worked or consulted for are Keebler Company, HÃ¤agen-Dazs Company, Norand Corporation, Pepsi-Cola, Continental Baking Company, NYNEX et Law Bulletin Publishing Company.
about.background.description3=It has been a fascinating journey, from starting out programming in COBOL on mainframes through developing desktop software for Windows 3.1 to creating this cloud-based website.
about.technical.title=Technical details
about.technical.description1=Although I am technically retired, I hope to use this website as a calling card, as it were, for prospective employers that have a short-term need for a skilled web developer.

### beta test
beta.notasignup=Wait, this doesn't look like a sign up page?
beta.description1=Actually, RecipeOrganizer is currently undergoing beta testing. What does that mean?  Well, as much as every programmer likes to think that every line of code they write is perfect, there always ends up being a bug (or two) that make their way into the finished product.   
beta.description2=So, RecipeOrganizer has a team of volunteers who are testing our website (actually, trying to break it) to help ensure you have the best experience possible when it is released.
beta.description3=If you would like to be notified when RecipeOrganizer is open to the public just email us at {0} and we''ll respond with a notification when we cut the ribbon on the website.
beta.description4=If you can''t wait and would like to get a sneak peek at RecipeOrganizer, then email us at {0} to join our team of beta testers. Only those who are willing to provide feedback on their testing experience should apply. Anyone fluent in French would be especially welcome to help with our French translations.
beta.thanks=Thanks for your interest in RecipeOrganizer. We hope to see you back soon!
