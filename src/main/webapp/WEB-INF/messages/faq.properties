faq.topic.7.question.5=What does Qualifier mean?
faq.topic.7.answer.5=Generally, we prefer to keep our ingredient names simple, e.g., Onion, Chicken, Chocolate, but often the ingredients in recipes indicate either a more specific type of ingredient or a method for preparing it. An onion may be sliced or diced, chicken may be boneless or skinless, chocolate may be unsweetened. Those kinds of additional descriptors should be entered as a Qualifier. A list of suggestions from previously entered recipes will be displayed after typing at least one letter.

faq.topic.7.question.10=Does the order in which I enter the ingredients matter?
faq.topic.7.answer.10=When you view the finished recipe ingredients are displayed in the order in which you entered them. Many recipes list ingredients in the order in which they are used, but it is up to you how you would like them to appear.
faq.topic.7.question.11=Can I change the order of the ingredients?
faq.topic.7.answer.11=At this time the only way to change the order is to delete and re-add ingredients individually.

faq.topic.7.answer.12=If you indicated on the Basic Information page that you have more than one set of Ingredients, then you must identify each set with a name.
