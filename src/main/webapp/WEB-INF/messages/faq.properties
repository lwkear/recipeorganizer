faq.topic.5.description=Submitting a recipe
faq.topic.5.question.1=How do I submit a recipe?
faq.topic.5.answer.1=RecipeOrganizer provides a "wizard" to assist you with entering a recipe. The wizard will walk you through five pages:<ul><li>Basic Information</li><li>Ingredients</li><li>Instructions</li><li>Optional Information</li><li>Review</li></ul>To get started select Submit a Recipe from the Recipe menu.<br><br><img src="resources/images/faq_en/MenuRecipesSubmit.png"/>
faq.topic.5.question.2=What does the Cancel button do?
faq.topic.5.answer.2=On any of the wizard's five pages you can decide to discard what you have entered by clicking on Cancel.<br><br><img src="resources/images/faq_en/CancelRecipe.png"/>
faq.topic.5.question.3=Can I enter part of a recipe, save it, then enter the rest later?
faq.topic.5.answer.3=Technically no, since the wizard does not allow you to skip any of the five pages. However, as long as you enter the minimum requirements on each page, then you can save your recipe and complete it later by editing it. If you have opted to Share the recipe, then we would recommend that you enter a brief note in one of the text entries like Background or Notes to indicate that the recipe is not done. This will let the Editor know that the recipe is a work in progress and it is not yet ready to be reviewed. 
faq.topic.5.question.4=How long does it take to enter a recipe?
faq.topic.5.answer.4=It depends on several factors: the number of ingredients, the number of instructions, whether or not you fill in the optional pieces of information, etc. We have found that after entering the first few recipes, the Basics and Ingredients pages can be completed fairly quickly. The Instructions page, though, can take some time if you are entering a personal recipe. The instructions for many of our handed-down recipes are often written in an abbreviated shorthand that you understand perfectly, but may not make sense to another Member, especially a less experienced cook. In general, though, most recipes can be entered in around 15 minutes or so.
faq.topic.5.question.5=Why does my recipe need to be reviewed?
faq.topic.5.answer.5=Any recipe that is shared with other Members must be reviewed by an Editor.<br><img src="resources/images/faq_en/ShareRecipeYes.png"/><br>This serves a two-fold purpose.  First, an Editor will work with the Member who submitted the recipe to fix any typos or other errors and to make sure the recipe is clear and understandable. Second, the review process ensures that no objectionable content is ever allowed to be viewed by other Members.
faq.topic.5.question.6=How will I know when the review of my recipe has been completed?
faq.topic.5.answer.6=You will receive a message from the Editor that indicates the status of your recipe:<ul><li>Approved: your shared recipe can be viewed by other Members</li><li>Pending: the Editor has made changes or has questions about your recipe</li><li>Blocked: your recipe contains questionable content and will not be made available for public access</li><li>Deleted: your recipe violates RecipeOrganizer's standards has been deleted by the Editor</li></ul>Once shared recipes are Approved they will be accessible to other Members via Search results. Here are two sample Editor messages:<br><br><img src="resources/images/faq_en/MessagePopupApproved.png"/><br><br><img src="resources/images/faq_en/MessagePopupReview.png"/>
faq.topic.5.question.7=How long does the review process take?
faq.topic.5.answer.7=Generally, we will review recipes and respond to the submitter within 24 hours, but on occasion it may take a bit longer. You can view your recipe even while it is being reviewed but other Members will not see it appear in their search results.
faq.topic.5.question.8=An Editor made some changes to my recipe. How do I respond to the Editor?
faq.topic.5.answer.8=On the Messages page click on <img src="resources/images/faq_en/IconMessage.png"/> on the appropriate row to respond to the Editor.
faq.topic.5.question.9=What do I do if I don't agree with the Editor's changes?
faq.topic.5.answer.9=Our Editors are tasked with maintaining RecipeOrganizer's standards for recipe content, so if you and the Editor cannot come to an agreement then you must opt to not share the recipe. You will still have full access to the recipe but no other Members will be able to view it.
faq.topic.5.question.10=Why does my recipe need to be reviewed after I edited it?
faq.topic.5.answer.10=When you edit a recipe you can change any of the recipe's content, so the same reasons for the initial review apply.
faq.topic.5.question.11=What does the small "i" in a circle on some pages of the wizard signify?
faq.topic.5.answer.11=Hover your mouse over the <img src="resources/images/faq_en/IconInfo.png"/> to see information or suggestions on what to enter in a particular field.
faq.topic.6.count=5
faq.topic.6.description=Recipe: Basics
faq.topic.6.question.1=What do I enter on the Basic Information page?
faq.topic.6.answer.1=There are only three items that you need to enter or select:<ul><li>Name</li><li>Description</li><li>Category</li></ul>Servings, Preparation Time and Total Time are optional.
faq.topic.6.question.2=What is the purpose of the recipe Description?
faq.topic.6.answer.2=The recipe Description appears in search results, along with the recipe Name and a photo of the finished product, if one is available. A good description will let other Members know the essentials of the recipe.
faq.topic.6.question.3=What happens if I decide not to share a recipe?
faq.topic.6.answer.3=If you select No then only you will be able to view the recipe and it will not appear in other Members' search results.<br><img src="resources/images/faq_en/ShareRecipeNo.png"/>
faq.topic.6.question.4=What does it mean to have more than one set of ingredients or instructions?
faq.topic.6.answer.4=Some recipes consist of multiple parts, for example, one set of ingredients and instructions for making a cake and a separate set for making the icing. Most recipes only have one set, so you can leave the default answer to No.<br><br><img src="resources/images/faq_en/MultipleSetsNo.png"/><br><br>If you have more than one set, select Yes and enter how many sets there are (the wizard defaults to 2). You can mix and match as well, e.g., two sets of ingredients and one set of instructions or vice versa.<br><br><img src="resources/images/faq_en/MultipleSetsYes.png"/>
faq.topic.6.question.5=Why can't I enter two recipes with the same name?
faq.topic.6.answer.5=Entering a unique name for each of your recipes will help you better identify which recipe is which when you view all your recipes on the My Recipes page. It is possible, though, for more than one Member to enter a recipe with the same name, say Chocolate Brownies, since each recipe is identified by the Member that submitted it.
faq.topic.7.count=13
faq.topic.7.description=Recipe: Ingredients
faq.topic.7.question.1=What do I enter on the Ingredients page?
faq.topic.7.answer.1=There are only two requirements for each ingredient: Quantity and Ingredient name. You must enter at least one Ingredient for the recipe.
faq.topic.7.question.2=What does Measure mean?
faq.topic.7.answer.2=Measure is a description of the quantity, e.g., Cup, Teaspoon, Ounce, Pint, etc. A number of different measures are pre-loaded for you - just type the first letter and a list will appear. Use the down arrow to select the measure you want then hit the tab key twice to select that measure.<br><br><img src="resources/images/faq_en/Measure.png"/><br><br>You can also enter your own measure if the one you require isn't automatically displayed.
faq.topic.7.question.3=How do I enter an ingredient name?
faq.topic.7.answer.3=You have a choice of manually typing the full ingredient name or letting the wizard offer a list of suggestions. Just type the first 2 or more letters of the ingredient and a list of all ingredients that contain those letters will appear. Use the down arrow to select the ingredient you want then hit the tab key twice to select that ingredient.<br><br><img src="resources/images/faq_en/Ingredient.png"/><br><br>If your ingredient doesn't appear in the list just type the name and it will be added to the suggestion list for the next time you enter a recipe with that ingredient.<br><br><em>Tip: The wizard will automatically capitalize any new ingredient name you enter.</em>
faq.topic.7.question.4=Why did I get an error message when I typed two letters for an ingredient name then hit tab?
faq.topic.7.answer.4=The minimum length of an ingredient name is 3 characters.<br><br><img src="resources/images/faq_en/IngredientError.png"/>
faq.topic.7.question.5=What does Additional mean?
faq.topic.7.answer.5=Generally, we prefer to keep our ingredient names simple, e.g., Onion, Chicken, Chocolate, but often the ingredients in recipes indicate either a more specific type of ingredient or a method for preparing it. An onion may be sliced or diced, chicken may be boneless or skinless, chocolate may be unsweetened. Those kinds of additional descriptors should be entered in the Additional field. A list of suggestions from previously entered recipes will be displayed after typing at least one letter. To use one of these descriptors just use the down arrow to select the one you want and hit the tab key twice, or simply add your own descriptor.<br><br><img src="resources/images/faq_en/Qualifier.png"/>
faq.topic.7.question.6=I entered my first ingredient but how do I add another ingredient?
faq.topic.7.answer.6=Click on <img src="resources/images/faq_en/PlusSign.png"/> and a new ingredient row will appear. Repeat this for as many ingredients the recipe requires.

faq.topic.7.answer.9=You can click on <img src="resources/images/faq_en/MinusSign.png"/> to remove an empty row, or just do nothing. When you are done entering ingredients and are ready to enter the Instructions, the wizard will automatically delete any empty rows you haven't already removed.
faq.topic.7.question.10=Does the order in which I enter the ingredients matter?
faq.topic.7.answer.10=When you view the finished recipe, ingredients are displayed in the order in which you entered them. Many recipes list ingredients in the order in which they are used, but it is up to you how you would like them to appear.
faq.topic.7.question.11=Can I change the order of the ingredients?
faq.topic.7.answer.11=At this time the only way to change the order is to delete and re-add ingredients individually.
faq.topic.7.question.12=What is the purpose of the "Name for Set #1" entry box?
faq.topic.7.answer.12=If you indicated on the Basic Information page that you have more than one set of Ingredients, then you must identify each set with a name. An example for a two-set recipe would be "For the cake" for Set #1 and "For the icing" for Set #2.<br><br><img src="resources/images/faq_en/SetName.png"/>
faq.topic.7.question.13=What does the Back button do?

It is important to note that if you close your browser or close the tab where you are editing a recipe before clicking on the Save button, your changes to that recipe will be lost.
faq.topic.11.question.5=Why is there no Review option?
faq.topic.11.answer.5=We assume that your changes will usually be minor and therefore you won't need to review the entire recipe. After you click on Save, the next page that appears includes a View Recipe button that will display your updated recipe.
faq.topic.11.question.6=Why does my recipe need to be reviewed after I edited it?

faq.topic.16.question.1=How do I listen to a recipe?
faq.topic.16.answer.1=When you view a recipe simply click on one of the play buttons <img src="resources/images/faq_en/PlayAudioButton.png"/> to hear the related section of the recipe, e.g., ingredients or instructions.
faq.topic.16.question.2=Which parts of the recipe can be listened to?
faq.topic.16.answer.2=You can listen to the ingredients, instructions, notes and your private notes (if available). If there are more than one set of ingredients or instructions, you can listen to each set separately.
faq.topic.16.question.3=Do I have a choice of voices?
faq.topic.16.answer.3=Yes. There are four English voices, three American and one British, and one French voice. You can select your preferred voice at any time on your Profile page.
faq.topic.16.question.4=When I view a recipe why don't I see any play buttons?
faq.topic.16.answer.4=Chrome, Firefox and Opera are capable of playing the type of audio used by RecipeOrganizer, but Internet Explorer, Edge and Safari are not. For those browsers the play buttons will not appear on the recipe page and you cannot select a voice on your Profile page. For the technically minded, audio is provided in the Ogg Theora Vorbis format.
faq.topic.16.question.5=Can I change the speed of the audio playback?
faq.topic.16.answer.5=No, not at this time. Currently, there is a three second pause between each ingredient and each instruction step in the recipe. Send us some feedback if you think this pause needs to be adjustable.
faq.topic.16.question.6=Why can't I pause or stop the audio playback?
faq.topic.16.answer.6=We are hard at work on the next release of RecipeOrganizer which will allow you to speak aloud various commands, including "pause" and "stop". That feature will supercede the need for additional control buttons on the recipe page. If you feel that those buttons would still be helpful please let us know by sending us a feedback email on this topic.
faq.topic.16.question.7=What happens if I play a recipe written in French?
faq.topic.16.answer.7=The recipe is always read in the language in which it was submitted. If you are viewing RecipeOrganizer in English and select a recipe written in French, you will hear it in French, and vice versa. This is because listening to a French recipe in English will simply not make sense.
faq.topic.16.question.8=Who is providing the audio for RecipeOrganizer?
faq.topic.16.answer.8=We are thrilled to be working with IBM's Watson to provide you with the audio for our website. IBM's Watson gained fame when it won Jeopardy! in 2011, and since then IBM has expanded their technology to offer an entire suite of cognitive services. We are using Watson's Text To Speech service to create the audio that you hear on our website, and we are working to incorporate Watson's Speech To Text service in the very near future.
